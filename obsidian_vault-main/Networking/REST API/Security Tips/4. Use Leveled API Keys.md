API Keys are common way to authenticate and authorize service-to-service communications. Such as when a back end service needs to communicate with the 3rd party APIs or our own internal APIs. However, using a single API key for all services and operations can be risky. Instead, implement API keys with varying access levels, where each key has a specific permissions and scopes defined. For example, we could have a "read-only" key for public data access, a "write" key for modifying internal data stores, and an "admin" key for the privilege operations like deploying updates.

This way, even if one API key is compromised, the attackers access is limited only to the operations allowed by the keys level. We minimize the pass radius compared to using a single master key. It's also a good practice to rotate API keys periodically and have an easy way to revoke compromised keys immediately. Some services also let us configure the expiration times for API keys.
