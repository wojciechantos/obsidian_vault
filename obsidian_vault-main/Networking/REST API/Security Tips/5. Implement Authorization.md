Authorization is the process of determining what resources and actions a client is allowed to access or perform. Even if a client is authenticated, they should only be able to access and modify the data they are authorized for. A common pattern is to use RBAC (Role Based Access Control), where clients have assigned roles with specific permissions. For example a viewer may be able to read data while an editor can also modify it. Proper authorization ensures that our API follows "the principle of least privilege" minimizing risk of the potential attack.
