Proper error handling is crucial for API Security and User Experience. When errors occur we want to provide clients with descriptive and secure error messages. For example, instead of a vague:


> "Internal Server Error"

a better message could be like:

> "Failed to retrieve user data. Please check that you are authenticated and have sufficient permissions."

This gives the client enough information to troubleshoot without exposing sensitive details. It is generally good to categorize errors as client errors such as validation failures or server errors and return appropriate Status Codes like:

==NEVER EVER RETURN FULL STACK TRACES!==

or expose internal error messages or codes as this can be a valuable information for attackers. The goal is to help legitimate clients while protecting sensitive information and attack factors.
