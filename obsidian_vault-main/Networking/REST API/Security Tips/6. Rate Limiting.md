Rate limiting controls the number of the requests the client can make in a given time period. This helps protect our API from being overwhelmed by malicious actors or buggy clients making excessive requests. Rate limiting rules can be based on various factors like IP address, user ID or API key. We can also have different rate limits for different types of requests or resources. For example, we may allow more READ requests and WRITE requests per second. Rate limiting improves security and helps maintain the performance and availability of your API.
