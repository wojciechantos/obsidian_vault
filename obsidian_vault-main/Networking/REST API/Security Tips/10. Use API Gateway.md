An API Gateway accesses a single entry point for clients to access a back end services and APIs. It provides a centralized layer for enforcing security policies, rate limiting, authentication and other cross cutting concerns. By using an API Gateway we can abstract away the complexity of managing the security features across the individual services or APIs. API Gateways also offers additional benefits like traffic management, caching, logging or monitoring, making them a valuable component in modern application architectures.
