Allow listing is a security technique where we explicitly allow access only to a predefined set of trusted entities such as IP addresses, user IDs or API keys. Everything else is denied by default. This approach follows the principle of "Deny All, Permit Some", which is more secure than a "Deny Listing" approach, where we deny a few known bad actors and allow everyone else.

In the context of APIs we can implement Allow Listing rules based on various criteria, such as allowing specific IP ranges to access certain endpoints, or limiting access to certain resources based on user roles or permissions.
