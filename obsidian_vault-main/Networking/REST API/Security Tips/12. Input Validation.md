Implement robust input validation for all data received from clients. This includes validating request parameters, headers, payloads, and any other user supplied input. Failing to validate input can lead to various vulnerabilities like "SQL Injection", "Cross-site scripting" attack and other injection attacks. Input validation should be done on both the Client Side and Server Side as Client Side validation alone is not sufficient. On the Server Side we can use dedicated input validation libraries or frameworks to enforce strict validation rules and sanitize user input. It is also a good practice to centralize and standardize a validation logic either through an API Gateway or a separate validation service.
