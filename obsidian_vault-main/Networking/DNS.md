==DNS is a system that converts domain names to IP addresses.==

Domain Name System is like a giant phone book of the internet. The DNS is managed by the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) non-profit organization. Whenever our computer attempts to resolve a domain name, it contacts one of ICANN's "root nameservers", whose address is included in our computer's networking configuration. From there, that nameserver can gather the domain records for a specific domain name from their distributed DNS database. ICANN is like a publisher that keeps the phone book in print and available.
