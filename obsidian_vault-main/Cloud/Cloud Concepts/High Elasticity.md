A High Elasticity term stands for the ability to **automatically** increase or decrease capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory, and computing power.

Vertical Scaling is generally hard for traditional architecture so you'll usually only see horizontal scaling described with Elasticity.

- Scaling OUT - **Adding** more servers of the same size
- Scaling IN - **Removing** more servers of the same size

##### Azure examples: 
To accomplish High Elasticity on Azure use:
- [[Azure VM Scale Sets]]
- [[SQL Server Stretch Database]]
