A High Scalability term stands for the ability to increase capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power.

There are few different types of Scaling:

1. **Vertical Scaling** (Scaling Up) - upgrade to a bigger server
2. **Horizontal Scaling** (Scaling Out) - adding additional servers of the same size
