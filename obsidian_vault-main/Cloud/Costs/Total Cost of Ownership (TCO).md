When choosing solution for our services, we should consider not only those costs that matter for us the most, but also hidden costs which not always can be visible at first sight and can lead to unexpected costs overrun. Usually On-Premise solution looks much more cost effective, but when we take the TCO and all the costs involved it can look totally different. Here are the aspects that differentiate solutions:

On-Premise (CAPEX) - we look at the Software License fees:
- Implementation
- Configuration
- Training
- *Physical Security*
- *Hardware*
- *IT Personal*
- *Maintenance*

Azure (OPEX) - we look at the Subscription fees:
- Implementation
- Configuration
- Training


The amount of savings when choosing OPEX solution can reach out up to **75%**.
