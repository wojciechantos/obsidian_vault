A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped in various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services for **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** would be:

### Compute
Imagine having a virtual computer that can run application, programs and code.

### Storage
Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.

### Networking
Imagine having a virtual network being able to define internet connections or network isolations.

### Databases
Imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web application.

*The term "Cloud Computing" can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has "compute" in the name.*
