### CLOUD COMPUTING
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

*The term "Cloud Computing" can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has "compute" in the name.*

## Benefits of cloud computing

- **COST EFFECTIVE** - You pay what you consume, no up-front cost. Pay-as-you-go which in practice means that thousands of customers share the cost of the resources.
- **GLOBAL** - Launch workloads anywhere in the world, just choose a region.
- **SECURE** - Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services can be secure by default or you have the ability to configure access down to granular level.
- **RELIABLE** - Data backup, disaster recovery and data replication, and fault tolerance.
- **SCALABLE** - Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand.
- **ELASTIC** - Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand.
- **CURRENT** - The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider without interruption to you (99%).
