1. ***What are React hooks?*** - hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle methods, and other react features.
2. **What is the purpose of the `useState()` hook?** - the `useState()` hook is used to add state to functional components in React.
3. ***Explain the `useEffect()` hook*** - it is a React hook used for side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions or manually changing the DOM.
4. **What is the purpose of the `useReducer()` hook?** - it is used for state management in functional components. It is particularly useful when the state logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state.
5. **What is the purpose of the `useImperativeHandle()` hook?** - it is used to customize the instance value that is exposed when using React.forwardRef.

7. ***Explain the concept of `useContext()` hook*** - the `useContext()` hook is used to access the value of a React context within a functional component.
8. ***What is the significance of the `useCallback()` hook?*** - `useCallback()` is used to memoize callback functions, preventing them from being recreated on every render.
9. ***Explain the purpose of the `useMemo()` hook*** - the `useMemo()` hook is used to memoize the result of a function, preventing unnecessary calculations and improving performance.
10. **What is the purpose of the `useLayoutEffect()` hook?** - it is similar to `useEffect()`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is often used for measuring and synchronizing layout.
